A silver-medal winning undergraduate video submission for Vegetation Ecology (Course Level?) covering the stranger side of landscape reflectance. I'm going to try and make this section a bit longer to make this look like a legitimate website entry. I'm not sure how long it will need to be to look nice, so I'm just going to kind of ramble on here for a few sentences just to get an idea of the ideal length of an entry. Let's see how this looks!
